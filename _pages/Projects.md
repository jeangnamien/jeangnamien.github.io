## **Malware Detection via Audio Processing Tools & Deep Learning**
**Status:** Ongoing — 2025  
**Type:** Research Project  

The goal of this project is to detect malware by analyzing executable files as **audio signals**.  
The workflow includes:

- Converting binary executable data into spectrogram-like audio representations  
- Applying digital signal processing (DSP) tools  
- Training deep learning models (CNNs, CRNNs, and spectrogram-based architectures)  
- Classifying malware families based on their acoustic signatures  
- Benchmarking performances against traditional static and dynamic malware analysis techniques  

This project explores how *malicious behavioral patterns* can emerge in the frequency domain, offering a novel way to detect malware while avoiding obfuscation and code-packing techniques.


## **COVID-19 Propagation Modeling in Casablanca**
